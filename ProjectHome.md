# Undo Closed Tabs Button #

---

### Introduction ###
Tired of going to _History -> Recently Closed Tabs_ just to undo a closed tab? Then this extension is for you! This extension allows you to undo closed tabs via a toolbar button and/or tab bar button. Click the image one time to undo the last closed tab...three times to open the last three closed tabs and so on. Click the drop down arrow to see the list of last previously closed tabs and select which one you would like to undo.

You can also undo closed tabs by using the CTRL + SHIFT + Z shortcut key and also a right-click context menu entry.

There is a options menu (_Tools -> Add-ons -> Extensions_), here you can edit the amount of closed tabs to remember, hide the history menu from the toolbar button, remove the right-click context menu entry or remove the tab bar button.

**Important:** You must add the button to the navigation toolbar by going to _View -> Toolbars -> Customize_, then drag and drop the button anywhere on the toolbar. The tab bar button is shown by default.
