=== UCTB does not work ===
There appears to be some extensions that has disabled a default preference that is set by Firefox 2 and 3 when you install Firefox.  I have coded to set this preference into this extension but it does not always work.  It's an easy fix for you though...

  # Type in *_about:config_* into the location bar and hit enter
  # Read the disclaimer and proceed
  # In the blank text input line, type or paste *_browser.sessionstore.enabled_* or just scroll down the list and look for it manually
  # Right-click the preference and select the "reset" reset option or double-click the preference to reset it.

=== How can I change to shortcut key? ===

Sorry but I had to change it in order to keep my extension on AMO.

You'll have to manually do this for each release. I can't set it to really anything else do to the way mozilla polices the use of shortcuts from extensions.

Find 'firefoxOverlay.xul' in your profile. Like here
_C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\743jcsho.default\extensions\undoclosedtabsbutton@supernova00.biz\chrome\content_

Find this code:
{{{
<keyset>
<key id="uctb-key" modifiers="control,shift" keycode="z" oncommand="undoCloseTab();"/>
</keyset>
}}}

and change the modifiers="control,shift" to just "control" or "shift and keycode="z" to "a" or whatever letter you want.
