### What is Technology Evangelism? ###
In the simplest terms, Technology Evangelism is the promotion of a specific technology. However, this simple view misses the scope and importance of Technology Evangelism. In order for Mozilla to succeed, we cannot rely on the adage, If we build it they will come, but we must instead actively promote Mozilla in every way possible.

### What is Mozilla? ###
Mozilla is a suite of applications which includes a standards-based Web browser, an e-mail/news Client, and an IRC client as well as a toolkit for developing cross-platform, Internet-based applications. The Mozilla toolkit is the basis for not only the Mozilla browser but also Netscape 6, Netscape 7, CompuServe 7, Firefox, Galeon, and Camino, all of which embed Mozilla's Gecko rendering engine.

### Having problems with a site? ###
The single most important factor in whether a web site supports Mozilla and its family of browsers is how does the lack of support for Mozilla affect the bottom line. Complaining to web sites can be an effective means of waking a web site up to the fact that there is [more than one browser in the world](http://www.geckoisgecko.org/).
